# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Client Manager

A lightweight client management app built with React and Supabase.

## Problem
Freelancers and small businesses often track clients in notes or spreadsheets, which quickly becomes messy.

## Solution
A simple interface to add, view, edit, and manage clients with notes in one place.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete clients
- Notes per client
- Real-time database with Supabase
- Responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- Supabase
- CSS

## Product Decisions
- Kept scope intentionally small to focus on usability
- Notes field added after considering real freelancer workflows
- Minimal UI to reduce cognitive load

## What I'd Improve Next
- Authentication
- Client tags (e.g. Active / Lead)
- Search and filtering
