# Client Manager

A lightweight client management app built with React and Supabase.

## Problem
Freelancers and small businesses often track clients in notes or spreadsheets, which quickly becomes messy.

## Solution
A simple interface to add, view, edit, and manage clients with notes in one place.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete clients
- Notes per client
- Real-time database with Supabase
- Responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- Supabase
- CSS

## Product Decisions
- Kept scope intentionally small to focus on usability
- Notes field added after considering real freelancer workflows
- Minimal UI to reduce cognitive load

## What I'd Improve Next
- Authentication
- Client tags (e.g. Active / Lead)
- Search and filtering
